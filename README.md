About SleekWP
=============

SleekWP is a barebones HTML5 WordPress-theme that comes bundled with plenty of clever (and optional!) SASS, JavaScript and WordPress tweaks.

It’s aimed at developers wanting to focus more on what’s unique to their project and a little less on the typical WordPress stuff like registering custom post types or sidebars.

SleekWP’s templates are written to be as semantically correct and accessible as possible, leaving all design and behavior to CSS and JS. You’ll be hard pressed to find a redundant div or class.

## What makes it special?

SleekWP embraces a very modular separation of code where each part of your WordPress site has its own file for HTML, CSS and JS. This way “modules” may easily be shared across sites, and you only need to include the stuff you really want.

When building your own site with SleekWP, you’ll be setting up a child theme that inherits all of SleekWP’s functionality. From your child you can easily override Sleek’s built in HTML, CSS and JS, and you can also leverage some of SleekWP’s PHP functions for easier custom post type registration, sidebars, thumbnails or just general fixes and cleanups.

## Get started

Getting started is super easy, just download WordPress and then download SleekWP, do a normal WP install and select SleekChild as your theme.

SleekChild is an example child theme based on SleekWP and is a good starting point for building your own theme. When you have everything set up, head over to the documentation to get a grip of all things SleekWP.
