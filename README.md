## About SleekWP

SleekWP is a barebones HTML5 WordPress-theme that comes bundled with plenty of clever (and optional!) SASS, JavaScript and WordPress tweaks.

SleekWP’s templates are written to be as semantically correct and accessible as possible, leaving all design and behavior to CSS and JS. You’ll be hard pressed to find a redundant div or class.

## Get started

Getting started is super easy, just [download and install WordPress](http://wordpress.org) then download SleekWP and SleekChild and set it as your active theme.

SleekChild is an example child theme based on SleekWP and is a good starting point for building your own theme. When you have everything set up, head over to [the documentation](/documentation/) to learn more.
