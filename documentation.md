# SleekWP Documentation

## File and folder structure

### / (root)

Contains all WordPress templates for every page type like `front-page.php`, `search.php` etc. These files are mostly empty except for `get_template_part()` calls which include modules.

### acf/

Contains all Advanced Custom Fields definitions and flexible content module templates. These will be covered in a separate chapter.

### dist/

Dist contains files generated by Gulp. Never put anything in there manually, the dist/ folder isn't even included in the repo by default.

### inc/

Contains PHP functions or third party PHP libraries included by `functions.php`.

### languages/

Contains all mo/po files for the theme's supported languages. Optionally contains Sleek language overrides inside `languages/sleek/`.

### modules/

Contains all modules used on the site such as `latest-news.php` or `recent-comments.php` etc.

### node_modules/

Contains JS or CSS packages installed with NPM. Never include this folder in the repo.

### src/

Contains all CSS, JS and assets (SVG, PNG etc).

## Modules and Templates

WordPress uses the templates located in your theme root for every page type it displays. For example on the search results page the `search.php` template is used, and in the archive the `index.php` template is used.

These templates should be kept clean from PHP or HTML and ideally should only _include_ modules they need. This way modules can be moved around and re-used with ease.

Every module should contain just one root element and be responsible for one single part of the page - never more. Also, give your root element an ID corresponding to the module's filename. The ID can be used for unique styling if needed.

For example:

**search.php**

`<?php get_header() ?>

<main>

	<?php get_template_part('modules/search-header') ?>
	<?php get_template_part('modules/search-results') ?>
	<?php get_template_part('modules/pagination') ?>

</main>

<?php get_footer() ?>`

**modules/search-header.php**

`<header id="search-header">

	<h1><?php printf(__('Search results for "%s"', 'my-textdomain'), get_search_query()) ?></h1>

	<p><?php printf(__('%s posts were found!', 'my-textdomain'), $wp_query->found_posts) ?></p>

</header>`

**modules/search-results.php**

`<section id="search-results">

	<?php while (have_posts()) : the_post() ?>
		<article>

			<h2><?php the_title() ?></h2>

			<?php the_excerpt() ?>

			<a href="<?php the_permalink() ?>"><?php _e('Read more', 'my-textdomain') ?></a>

		</article>
	<?php endwhile ?>

</section>`

Sleek contains templates and modules for all of WordPress' page types but more often than not you're going to want to override them. If that's the case, simply copy the file from `sleek/modules/posts.php` (for example) to `my-theme/modules/posts.php` and it'll be used instead.

## PHP libraries/functions

Sometimes it's necessary to override parts of WordPress, modify "the loop", alter the way a plugin works or just add a utility function that's specific to your theme.

While it's possible to put all such code directly inside `functions.php` it's better to keep each function/class/filter/action in its own file inside `inc/`.

For example:

**inc/sort-employees-by-name.php**

`<?php
add_filter('pre_get_posts', function ($query) {
	if (!is_admin() and $query->is_main_query()) {
		if (is_post_type_archive('employee') or is_tax('employee_category')) {
			$query->set('orderby', 'post_title');
			$query->set('order', 'ASC');
		}
	}
});`

And then include your file from `functions.php`:

`<?php
require_once 'inc/sort-employees-by-name.php';

# More code here...`

## The functions.php file

Sleek already comes with plenty of WordPress tweaks and utility functions aimed at speeding up common tasks such as registering custom post types, adding external script or CSS files and more. The `functions.php` is well documented and is probably the first file you're going to want to modify when starting with your new theme.

Here I'll explain each of its functions/sections from top to bottom.

### Enable search inside custom fields (including ACF)

Uncommenting this `require` will make the built-in WordPress search look inside custom fields as well as the "`the_content`". This is helpful if you have a lot of content inside advanced custom fields and you want that content to be considered when the user searches the site.

This functionality is commented by default as it modifies the main query and adds additional `JOIN`s. If you don't need this functionality it's unnecessary to run the code.

### Register thumbnail sizes

This is nothing special just the standard WordPress way of registering your thumbnail sizes. Only use this if you have to specify a crop. Stick to the built-in thumbnail sizes as much as possible.

### Actually, use WP's built in sizes as far as we can (cus they're gonna get created anyway on every upload)

Because WordPress automatically creates three thumbnail sizes and use them internally (in the admin, or by plugins) it's much better to simply modify their sizes and use them throughout your theme as much as possible;

`add_action('after_setup_theme', function () {
	update_option('thumbnail_size_w', 640);
	update_option('thumbnail_size_h', 480);
	update_option('thumbnail_crop', 1);
	update_option('medium_size_w', 1280);
	update_option('medium_size_h', 960);
	update_option('medium_crop', 1);
	update_option('large_size_w', 1920);
	update_option('large_size_h', 1080);
	update_option('large_crop', 1);
});`

### Register custom post types and taxonomies

Sleek comes with a utility function for registering custom post types. Simply pass an array of post type slugs into the function and they'll be registered using WordPress' `register_post_type()`. Should you want to override Sleek's default config for the post type you can pass in an associative array instead;

`sleek_register_post_types([
	'office',
	'employee',
	'case',
	'guide' => ['hierarchical' => true]
], 'my-textdomain');`

The last argument is your theme's textdomain. The registered post type's name and URL will be run through the `__()` function so that it can be translated using your theme's PO files.

The CPT's URL will be `url_name-of-post-type` so you'll want to translate that to something nicer;

**languages/sv_SE.po**

`msgid "Office"
msgstr "Kontor"

msgid "url_office"
msgstr "kontor"`

Remember to flush permalinks after you've made changes to URLs.

If you use WPML it's important _not to_ translate CPT slugs. In this case, _don't_ pass in a textdomain to `sleek_register_post_types()`. When no textdomain is supplied the URL will be the same as the name of the post type (and can later be translated inside the WPML admin).

Similarly to `sleek_register_post_types()` there's also a `sleek_register_taxonomies()` that takes an associative array of taxonomies and which post types they belong to. It's best practice (it's mandatory! :) to name taxonomies `the-name-of-the-post-type_category`. This way you'll namespace your taxonomies and ensure they never collide with another post type's taxonomy.

In rare cases you want a taxonomy shared between several CPTs, simply pass in multiple post type names if that's the case, and don't prefix the taxonomy name:

`sleek_register_taxonomies([
	'case_category' => ['case'],
	'country' => ['office', 'employee']
], 'my-textdomain');`


By default WordPress will show all registered post types on the search results page. While WP's `register_post_type()` function provides a method of disabling a CPT from appearing in search, using it also disables the CPTs archive page (it's a bug https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/20234). Instead you can use `sleek_set_cpt_in_search(['case', 'guide'])` to tell WP which post types you want to display on the SERP. Note that `post` and `page` are always displayed.

### Add meta data (title, description, image) to CPTs

Use this function to give post types an admin page where you can set a custom title, description and image (this is useful for prettying up your archive pages).

### Register CSS and JS (automatically adds dist/all.css and dist/all.js which are generated by $ gulp)

Use `sleek_register_assets()` to add both `all.css` and `all.js` to the site. These files are generated by gulp.

If you want to include more CSS or JS, simply pass the paths as an array to the function;

`sleek_register_assets(['https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:300,900'])`


### Register sidebars

Once again Sleek comes with a wrapper function for WordPress' `register_sidebar()`; `sleek_register_sidebars()`. Simply pass in an array of sidebar slugs and titles. You can optionally override Sleek's default config by passing in an associative array;

`sleek_register_sidebars([
	'aside' => [
		'name' => __('Aside', 'my-textdomain'),
		'before_title' => '<h3>',
		'after_title' => '</h3>'
	],
	'header' => __('Header', 'my-textdomain'),
	'footer' => __('Footer', 'my-textdomain')
]);`

### Add more options to Appearance -> Customize -> Theme Options

Sleek provides a utility function for easily adding fields to WordPress' Customize screen. These fields are useful for storing configuration variables like Google Analytics ID, Google Maps API Key etc. Simply register the field you need:

`add_action('customize_register', function ($wpCustomize) {
	sleek_register_theme_options($wpCustomize, [
		'my_cool_field' => 'text'
	], 'my-textdomain');
});`

And then use the field however you want; `$myCoolField = get_theme_mod('my_cool_field')`. Sleek has built-in handling of Google Analytics and Google Maps (as well as integration with ACF's Google Map field).

Using an ACF options page might make more sense in some cases however.

### Add more fields to users

It's not uncommon to want to add additional fields to users, the functions file contains the code needed to do so. There's nothing Sleek specific about this code, it's here simply so that one doesn't have to Google it every time.

### Give pages excerpts

Similarly to user fields, this is a common feature for most themes and is here for convenience.

### Set up for translation (put your mo/po-files in your-theme/languages/)

This code just adds your PO/MO files and textdomain. If you need to override some of Sleek's translations you can add an additional `languages/sleek/` folder and add your overrides there.
